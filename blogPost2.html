   CREATING A NEW TYPE OF USER INTERFACE 
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
    <p>
    User Interface is the piece of Designs that allows you to interact and communicate with a computer. Whether this is the touchscreen on your phone, a mouse and keyboard, 
 or a TV remote; they are the golden gateway to being able to use and understand our technology. 
 
 These examples I've just given are common household objects designed by tech companies
 to enable you to use their product. (They are not always successful in designing these with the user in mind. I mean, can you honestly tell me what every
 button on your TV remote does?)but the UI design is indeed the key to their success.

 Do you remember the old iPods with the scroll wheel? This famously innovative design seems so simple and user friendly. 
 The tech behind it is of course the complete opposite - but Apple were able to create an interface which is both intuitive and gives the user
 a great deal of control over the technology. (I will return to this idea of intuitive design)

    <p class="specialText">The posts that I plan to write in this space will be an agglomeration of my thoughts, projects, and experiences - all revolving around the topic of <b>Technology</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    I have always had a fascination with the the way modern technology can be used to explore and change the world. 
     Technology shapes everything in society in one way or another, and yet there is an exponential amount that we don't understand about it's potential or it's effects. There is actually <b>SO MUCH</b>
    experimenting, inventing, and tinkering to be done; that the power of the tech-pioneer is being subverted <i>away</i> from the huge tech companies (who own the means and money), to <b>anyone with an idea.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    My perspective on this is probably hugely influenced by my time spent working at Kaleider (<i>Exeter</i>) and Pervasive Media Studio (<i>Bristol</i>) which are cutting-edge organisations that welcome 
    creators and thinkers through their doors to hotdesk and collaborate on exciting and often ground-breaking projects that involve the use of technology in some way. Through them, I have 
    been involved with projects using VR, AR, 5G, AI, and some other formats that aren't 2 character abbreviations.

    <br>
    My interest in technology, much like the content of these posts, is not <i>really</i> about technology. It is about what we can do with it.
    I am currently in a process of exploring how it is changing my world, and how I can change the world around me - and I dont think I will ever stop. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="specialText"><b>What doors can we open? What patterns can we disrupt? What challenges can we overcome?</b></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    That is, essentially, what I am going to be giving thought to as I create, write, and learn. If you would like to follow what I make, or learn a thing or two about the enigmatic electrical 
    world you live in then subscribe to my blog and you will get an email notification every time I pop something new up.

    Don't worry, it won't be too often!
